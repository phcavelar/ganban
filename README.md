# Ganban

I'll be making here a Graph-based Kanban app prototype.

I've been using [Kanbanflow](https://kanbanflow.com/) to manage my projects but only its premium version allows relations between tasks to be set. I'd like to implement a graph/tree-based Kanban manager that allows one to set sub-goals to a major milestone/goal and focus on the low-level tasks while working, and on the big picture while planning.

For now I'm only following the [Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world), but as soon as I'm comfortable with Flask again I'll re-start the code and make the Kanban app.
